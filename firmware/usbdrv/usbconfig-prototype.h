/*
General Description:
This file is an example configuration (with inline documentation) for the USB
driver. It configures AVR-USB for an ATMega8 with USB D+ connected to Port D
bit 2 (which is also hardware interrupt 0) and USB D- to Port D bit 0. You may
wire the lines to any other port, as long as D+ is also wired to INT0.
To create your own usbconfig.h file, copy this file to the directory
containing "usbdrv" (that is your project firmware source directory) and
rename it to "usbconfig.h". Then edit it accordingly.
*/

/* ---------------------------- Hardware Config ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME      D
/* This is the port where the USB bus is connected. When you configure it to
 * "B", the registers PORTB, PINB and DDRB will be used.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT      0
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D- line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DPLUS_BIT       2
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D+ line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port. Please note that D+ must also be connected
 * to interrupt pin INT0!
 */

/* ----------------------- Optional Hardware Config ------------------------ */

/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME   D */
/* If you connect the 1.5k pullup resistor from D- to a port pin instead of
 * V+, you can connect and disconnect the device from firmware by calling
 * the macros usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() (see usbdrv.h).
 * This constant defines the port on which the pullup resistor is connected.
 */
/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_BIT          4 */
/* This constant defines the bit number in USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORT (defined
 * above) where the 1.5k pullup resistor is connected. See description
 * above for details.

/* --------------------------- Functional Range ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_HAVE_INTRIN_ENDPOINT    1
/* Define this to 1 if you want to compile a version with two endpoints: The
 * default control endpoint 0 and an interrupt-in endpoint 1.
 */

/* Define this to 1 if you want to compile a version with three endpoints: The
 * default control endpoint 0, an interrupt-in endpoint 1 and an interrupt-in
 * endpoint 3. You must also enable endpoint 1 above.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_HALT          0
/* Define this to 1 if you also want to implement the ENDPOINT_HALT feature
 * for endpoint 1 (interrupt endpoint). Although you may not need this feature,
 * it is required by the standard. We have made it a config option because it
 * bloats the code considerably.
 */
#define USB_CFG_INTR_POLL_INTERVAL      20
/* If you compile a version with endpoint 1 (interrupt-in), this is the poll
 * interval. The value is in milliseconds and must not be less than 10 ms for
 * low speed devices.
 */

/* Define this to 1 if the device has its own power supply. Set it to 0 if the
 * device is powered from the USB bus.
 */

/* Set this variable to the maximum USB bus power consumption of your device.
 * The value is in milliamperes. [It will be divided by two since USB
 * communicates power requirements in units of 2 mA.]
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_WRITE      0
/* Set this to 1 if you want usbFunctionWrite() to be called for control-out
 * transfers. Set it to 0 if you don't need it and want to save a couple of
 * bytes.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_READ       0
/* Set this to 1 if you need to send control replies which are generated
 * "on the fly" when usbFunctionRead() is called. If you only want to send
 * data from a static buffer, set it to 0 and return the data from
 * usbFunctionSetup(). This saves a couple of bytes.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_WRITEOUT   0
/* Define this to 1 if you want to use interrupt-out (or bulk out) endpoint 1.
 * You must implement the function usbFunctionWriteOut() which receives all
 * interrupt/bulk data sent to endpoint 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_HAVE_FLOWCONTROL        0
/* Define this to 1 if you want flowcontrol over USB data. See the definition
 * of the macros usbDisableAllRequests() and usbEnableAllRequests() in
 * usbdrv.h.

 */

/* ------------------- Fine Control over USB Descriptors ------------------- */
/* If you don't want to use the driver's default USB descriptors, you can
 * provide our own. These can be provided as (1) fixed length static data in
 * flash memory, (2) fixed length static data in RAM or (3) dynamically at
 * runtime in the function usbFunctionDescriptor(). See usbdrv.h for more
 * information about this function.
 * Descriptor handling is configured through the descriptor's properties. If
 * no properties are defined or if they are 0, the default descriptor is used.
 * Possible properties are:
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_DYNAMIC: The data for the descriptor should be fetched
 *     at runtime via usbFunctionDescriptor().
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_RAM: The data returned by usbFunctionDescriptor() or found
 *     in static memory is in RAM, not in flash memory.
 *   + USB_PROP_LENGTH(len): If the data is in static memory (RAM or flash),
 *     the driver must know the descriptor's length. The descriptor itself is
 *     found at the address of a well known identifier (see below).
 * List of static descriptor names (must be declared PROGMEM if in flash):
 *   char usbDescriptorDevice[];
 *   char usbDescriptorConfiguration[];
 *   char usbDescriptorHidReport[];
 *   char usbDescriptorString0[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringVendor[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringDevice[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringSerialNumber[];
 * Other descriptors can't be provided statically, they must be provided
 * dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * Descriptor properties are or-ed or added together, e.g.:
 * #define USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE   (USB_PROP_IS_RAM | USB_PROP_LENGTH(18))
 *
 * The following descriptors are defined:
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_CONFIGURATION
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRINGS
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_0
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_VENDOR
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_SERIAL_NUMBER
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID_REPORT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_UNKNOWN (for all descriptors not handled by the driver)
